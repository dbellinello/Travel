/**
 * weather.js — shared climate-normals widget
 *
 * ⚠️ HOME: Travel Website/assets/weather.js — PERMANENT, lives next to toolbar.js.
 * Auto-loaded by toolbar.js on guide pages AND the Guides index (same loader
 * pattern the retired footnote.js used). Never add a <script src=".../weather.js">
 * tag to a page by hand — toolbar.js injects it.
 *
 * Two contexts, one component:
 *   · On a guide (Guides/City/file.html) — a 🌡 Climate button (bottom-right)
 *     locked to that city; the panel shows its typical high/low for any month.
 *   · On Guides/guides_index.html — the same 🌡 button, but the panel opens with
 *     a city PICKER, so any city's climate is reachable without opening a guide.
 * Both share: a 12-month range strip, a month selector, and a °C/°F toggle
 * (remembered across pages via localStorage).
 *
 * DATA IS BAKED IN (the CLIMATE object below) — no fetch, no network. This is
 * deliberate: the guides are opened both from the live site AND as local files
 * straight from Drive (file://), where a fetch() of a sibling .json is blocked
 * by the browser. Inlining the data makes the widget work everywhere.
 *
 * The data is climate NORMALS — avg daily high/low (°C), 12 values Jan..Dec per
 * guide folder. Not a forecast; these typical averages do not shift, which is
 * why they may live in the guide. Regenerate with Brain/scripts/build_climate.py
 * (it rewrites both Guides/climate.json and the CLIMATE block below, between the
 * CLIMATE_DATA markers).
