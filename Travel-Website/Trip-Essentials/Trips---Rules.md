# Trips & Calendar — Rules & Decisions

Per Dani 2026-05-19 (*"add to the rules trip rules and calendar rules, needs to share 1 doc"*): trip-file rules and calendar rules live in one document. `Trips.html` and the shared **Leo&Dani Trips** Google Calendar are two surfaces over the same source of truth — they must stay in sync.

Read this before making any changes to `Trips.html` OR before creating/updating any calendar event. Every structural and content decision is documented here so future sessions don't have to rediscover them.

---

## File purpose

`Trips.html` is a live planning workspace for Dani's trips (some with Leo, some solo). Dani reads it on her iPhone via GitHub. It is **not** an archive — it's a quick-reference document meant to be scannable at a glance while traveling or planning.

---

## Trip order

- **Upcoming trips** come first, in chronological order by month.
- **Past trips** (return date has passed) move to the bottom under the gray **PAST TRIPS — 2026** banner. Never delete — just move down.
- When a new year starts or the file gets too long, move past trips to the `Archive` file and start fresh.

---

## Archive vs Past Trips section

| | Archive file | Past Trips (bottom of Trips.html) |
|---|---|---|
| What goes there | Trips from previous bulk period (e.g. Jan–Apr 2026) | Recently completed trips from the current active period |
| When to move | When the file starts getting long, or at natural breakpoints (end of semester, new year) | As soon as the return date passes |
| File name | `Archive 2026 Jan-Apr.html` (name reflects date range) | Stays in `Trips.html` |

---

## What to include / exclude

### ✅ Include
- Hotel name + plain-text address + Maps pin link
- Check-in and check-out dates
- Room type / bed type (kept short — one line)
- Booking status (✅ Booked, 🤔 Not confirmed, 📋 Planning)
- Flights: date · time · route · flight number
- Seat numbers as gray sub-detail (`.flight-detail`), not in the main line
- Trains: date · route · duration · booking action if still needed
- Venue: name + address + dates
- **From-hotel-to-venue line** — distance in km + walking time + ride-app time (see § "Hotel → venue distance" below)
- Flight booking refs (e.g. ref ZDIP3M) — keep, useful at the airport
- Action items (things still to book or do)

### ❌ Do NOT include
- **Leo's raw notes** — per Dani 2026-05-18: *"the html i dont need anything that leo wrote. i will give you any updates as he gives to me."* The yellow `.leo-notes` box is removed. Dani will paste anything from Leo that needs to land in the file.
- **Dani / Leo / Together section dividers** — per Dani 2026-05-18: *"no more dani and leo sections. keep just the things that matter."* All content inside a trip goes in one consolidated flow (Flights → Trains → Hotels → Venue → Action box), chronologically organized.
- **Any prose** — per Dani 2026-05-18: *"cut any prose."* No special-needs notes, no narrative remarks, no "booked on so-and-so's account" reminders. Keep just dates, addresses, room type one-liners, and action items.
- Confirmation numbers (#98122003 etc.)
- Hotel PIN codes
- Cancel deadlines ("Free cancel until May 15")
- Prices / totals (Total €1,644.45 etc.)
- Booking rate names ("MBR SAVE+ BKFST", "Member Stay For Breakfast Rate", "Flexible Rate")

## Card layout — every trip, same structure

Per Dani 2026-05-18 (*"always this order. leo stuff first"*), trips that involve a separation/reunion arc (e.g. Leo at an offsite while Dani travels solo, then meeting up) use these phase-ordered sections. **This order is mandatory** — Leo's stuff always comes before Dani's solo stuff, and Together always comes last:

1. **Trip title + status badge**
2. **✈️ Flights** — `.sec` with `🟣 Dani + Leo` pill (or whichever tag fits if they don't fly together). All legs, outbound and return, in chronological order.
3. **🏨 Leo's hotel / venue** — `.sec` with `🟢 Leo` pill. Leo's offsite hotel, any of his solo transit rows. If hotel and venue are the same place (common for offsites), one block — note "FRO offsite venue" on the dates line.
4. **🏨 Hotels + 🚆 Trains — Dani solo** — two distinct `.sec` blocks, both with `🔵 Dani` pill. Per Dani 2026-05-18: `🏨 Hotels` first (grouped by city using `.city-sub` labels), then `🚆 Trains`. Not interleaved.
5. **🏨 Hotels — Together** — `.sec` with `🟣 Dani + Leo` pill. Reunion hotels and onward, in chronological order.
6. **📖 Venue** (if there's a Dani or together venue separate from Leo's offsite) — with the hotel→venue distance line.
7. **🚗 Car Rental** (if any)
8. **⏳ Action box** (orange) — only things still to book or confirm

For trips with no separation (Dani solo all the way, e.g. Iceland; or Leo solo, e.g. Seoul; or Together the whole time, e.g. FLoC), skip the empty phases and keep the remaining sections in the same relative order.

### Who-tag on section labels

Every `.sec` that represents a phase tied to one person gets a who-tag pill at the end of the label. Per Dani 2026-05-18 (*"🚆 Getting Around - this is just mine has to just unde my name"*): when a whole section is solo-Dani or solo-Leo or together, the pill goes on the label so the whole block reads as theirs. Use the same pill styling as on hotel blocks. Inside `.sec`, the pill keeps its mixed-case label (uppercase is forced off via `.sec .who-tag`).

---

## Hotel block — required structure

Each hotel uses this exact order (per Dani 2026-05-18 — "make it easier to find the info"):

```html
<div class="booking-block">
  <div class="booking-name">Hotel Name · City</div>
  <p class="booking-dates">Jul 25 → Aug 3</p>
  <p class="addr-copy">Street address, postal code, city, country</p>
  <p>📍 <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=...">Open in Maps</a></p>
  <p>Room type · bed type · meal plan</p>
</div>
```

Why this order:
- **Hotel name** is the first thing on the line — the section header above already carries the who-tag pill, so no pill on the booking-name itself
- **Dates line** under the name — Dani sees check-in/out at a glance without parsing prose
- **Plain-text address** in a copyable gray box — for tap-and-hold → paste into Uber / Bolt / Apple Maps. Single tap selects the whole line (`user-select: all`).
- **Maps pin link** below — only the words "Open in Maps", not the address again. Saves vertical space and keeps the eye on the copy block.
- **Room type** as the last short line if useful

### Who-tag — calendar-matched color scheme

Per Dani 2026-05-19 (refined twice — *"leo and dai and just leo will be the green you chose update the rules"* → *"actually leave mine purple"*): the who-tag colors mirror Dani's Google Calendar event colors so the two surfaces tell the same story at a glance.

The mental model: **anything involving Leo is green; Dani alone is purple.**

| Tag | Class | Color | When |
|---|---|---|---|
| 🟣 Dani | `tag-solo` | Grape purple (`#7030A0`) | Dani only |
| 🟢 Leo | `tag-leo` | Sage green (`#2e7d32`) | Leo only |
| 🟢 Dani + Leo | `tag-together` | Sage green (`#2e7d32`) | Both — same green as Leo solo on purpose |

**Why Together and Leo share the green color:** Dani's request — anything that involves Leo carries the green signal. The label text still distinguishes them ("Leo" vs "Dani + Leo"), but at-a-glance color tells Dani "Leo is in this picture" vs "this is just me". Don't try to "fix" the duplication by reassigning Together to a different color.

**Calendar parity rule:** the Leo&Dani Trips Google Calendar uses the same scheme — Grape (`colorId 3`) for Dani-only events, Sage (`colorId 2`) for Leo events and Together events. If Dani recolors the calendar palette, flip the trips palette to match — and vice versa.

### Tag placement — section only, pill leads

Per Dani 2026-05-18 (*"i like the lable but no need to repeat before and after"* + *"name first"*): the who-tag pill lives on the **section header** (`.sec`), not on the individual `.booking-name`, and the **pill leads the line** — pill first, then the section icon and label.

```html
<div class="sec"><span class="who-tag tag-solo">🔵 Dani</span>🏨 Hotels</div>
```

Renders as: `🔵 Dani  🏨 HOTELS`

Rules:
- Every `.sec` whose content belongs to a specific person/group gets a **leading** `<span class="who-tag tag-...">` followed by the icon + label.
- `.booking-name` is hotel name only — no who-tag span inside, and no city suffix either (the city is on the `.city-sub` above the block).
- A `.sec` only ever holds entries of one tag type. If a trip has mixed phases (e.g. some Leo nights, some Dani solo, some together), use separate `.sec` blocks for each phase.
- Inside `.sec`, the pill keeps its mixed-case label (uppercase is forced off via `.sec .who-tag`).

### Hotels grouped by city — `.city-sub`

Per Dani 2026-05-18 (*"put hotels separated by city under my name"* + *"Sintra Hotel... Cascais Hotell"*): within a multi-hotel section, every hotel block is preceded by a `.city-sub` line labeled `[City] Hotel`. This becomes the visible identifier — Dani scans for "Sintra Hotel" or "Cascais Hotel", not the hotel brand name.

```html
<div class="sec"><span class="who-tag tag-solo">🔵 Dani</span>🏨 Hotels</div>

<p class="city-sub">Sintra Hotel</p>
<div class="booking-block">
  <div class="booking-name">Villa Bela Vista</div>
  ...
</div>

<p class="city-sub">Porto Hotel</p>
<div class="booking-block">
  <div class="booking-name">NH Porto Jardim</div>
  ...
</div>
```

Rules:
- Format: `[City] Hotel` (or `[City] Hotels` if there happen to be multiple in one city). Always English city name as Dani writes it on the trip card.
- The booking-name no longer carries the city suffix (it's redundant with the city-sub).
- Add `.city-sub` to every `🏨 Hotel`/`🏨 Hotels` section — even when the section only has one hotel. Consistency over brevity; Dani scans by city.
- Trains and flights don't get city-subs — those rows already carry the route inline.

### Plain-text address format

Use a clean, rideshare-friendly format with commas: `Street Number, Postal Code City, Country`. Examples:
- `Sarphatistraat 104, 1018 GV Amsterdam, Netherlands`
- `Rua Duque de Loulé 66, 4000-324 Porto, Portugal`
- `21 W Walnut St, Pasadena, CA 91103`

No `·` separators (rideshare apps choke on them). No emoji prefix in the copy block (defeats the purpose).

---

## Hotel → venue distance

Per Dani 2026-05-18 (*"time from hotel to venue is needed walk and ride app. i see the distance in km!"*): every venue block must end with a from-hotel-to-venue line.

Format: `From [Hotel Name]: 🚶 ~X km · ~N min walk · 🚕 ~N min Uber/Bolt`

Example:
```html
<p>From Lisbon Marriott: 🚶 ~1.5 km · ~20 min walk · 🚕 ~5 min Bolt</p>
```

Rules:
- Always include **km** first — Dani reads in metric.
- If not walkable, write `not walkable` in place of the walk-time.
- Pick the rideshare app appropriate to the country: Bolt for EU, Uber for US, etc.
- If multiple hotels share a venue, write one line per hotel pair.
- Source: Google Maps directions. If you can't verify, estimate based on coordinates and label nothing — don't fabricate exact minute values.

---

## Trip Overview section

(Optional — keep only if it's still in the file.) One line per trip, format: `MONTH · flag City — EventName · Dates · StatusBadge`.

---

## Status badges

| Badge | Color | Use when |
|---|---|---|
| ✅ Booked | Green | Fully booked, nothing left to do |
| ✅ Flights · [X] to book | Amber | Partially booked — describe what's missing |
| 📋 Planning | Blue | Dates roughly set, nothing booked yet |
| 🤔 Not confirmed | Amber/yellow, larger font | Trip not confirmed — don't book anything |
| ✅ Done | Green | Past trip |

The "Not confirmed" badge is intentionally larger than others — it must be immediately visible.

---

## Flight rows format

```
Date · Time · ORIGIN → DEST · FlightNumber · land HH:MM (if useful)
  [gray sub-detail: seat numbers, notes]
```

- One row per flight leg
- **No seat numbers anywhere.** Per Dani 2026-05-18 (*"remove all that: Dani 5A · Leo 6A this is noise no need"*): seat assignments are noise. They live in the airline app at boarding time, not in this doc. Don't reintroduce them in `.flight-detail`, inline, or anywhere else.
- Per Dani 2026-05-18 (*"Flights should more close together, not skipping line"* → *"the flight shoud not have space like the train"* → *"put all the lights close together. no space"*): `.flight-row` uses `padding: 1px 0; line-height: 1.3`. **No `margin-top` between outbound and return groups.** Each flight is a single line (no sub-detail sub-row unless absolutely needed for ops info). They pack as tight as train rows. Don't loosen this.
- `.flight-detail` is reserved for actual operational info that's still useful on the day — e.g. `KLM operated` for code-shares, `ref ZDIP3M` for booking refs at the airport. Anything else goes in the main row or doesn't go at all.

---

## Amsterdam layover pattern

Leo and Dani frequently route SEA → AMS → destination on Delta/KLM. When there's an overnight in Amsterdam, add a **Hyatt Regency Amsterdam** booking block in the Hotels list (chronologically). Address: `Sarphatistraat 104, 1018 GV Amsterdam, Netherlands`.

---

## Trains

- Format: `🚆 Date · Origin → Destination · operator/type · duration · [action if needed]`
- Always link to cp.pt for Portugal trains
- Trains that still need to be booked get `· **book on cp.pt**` in red bold
- Portugal trains: Alfa Pendular is the fast intercity service; regional trains for short hops (Lisbon → Sintra etc.)

---

## Action box rules

- Only appears when there is something **still to do** (book, confirm, contact)
- Items already done (✅) should NOT be in the action box — they just clutter it
- Format: bold red for the action verb, plain text for details
- "⏸️ Hold" pattern for trips not yet confirmed — include who needs to confirm

---

## Status: "Not confirmed" trips

Per Dani 2026-06-14 (*"when not confirmed this is all it should show"*): an unconfirmed trip shows **only the banner** — dates + title + the "Not confirmed" badge — and an **empty `.trip-body`**. Nothing else.

- Use the amber "Not confirmed" badge (`<span class="unconfirmed">Not confirmed</span>`).
- Leave the `.trip-body` empty — no hotel block, no flights, no venue, no action box, no "Hold" note.
- The badge alone communicates the status; the "don't book anything" reminder is redundant once the body is empty.
- As soon as the trip is confirmed, drop the badge and fill in the body (flights → hotels → venue → action box) per the normal layout.

---

## Font size — match the guides

Per Dani 2026-05-18 (*"The fonts of my trips html is too small. lets increase to match the guide's font size"*):

- Body: `17px` desktop, `21px` mobile. These are the Trips page's own sizes, set larger per Dani's request above. Note: `guide_v3.css` itself now uses a unified `14px` scale (mobile = desktop), so the Trips page is intentionally larger than the current guides — do not shrink it to "match."
- Mobile breakpoint: `@media (max-width: 600px)`.
- Other elements scale proportionally — see § "Mobile / technical requirements" and the CSS class reference below.

When in doubt, stay within the 14–20px desktop / 17–22px mobile range.

---

## Mobile / technical requirements

- **Always keep** `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">` in `<head>`. Critical for iPhone — without it, Safari shrinks everything to desktop size.
- Body margin: `24px 20px` default (mobile), `36px 48px` for screens ≥640px via media query.
- Font: Arial as primary, with `'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji'` for clean emoji rendering. Do NOT add Google Fonts or any external font — the file must load offline.
- No external CSS, JS, or image dependencies. Fully self-contained single file.
- File is read on iPhone 16 Pro (393px logical width) via GitHub.
- Test that long trip titles + badges wrap gracefully on narrow screens.
- Touch targets (links) should be large enough to tap — don't pack links too tightly.

---

## CSS class reference

| Class | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `.trip-card.booked` | Green left border — fully booked |
| `.trip-card.partial` | Amber left border — partially booked |
| `.trip-card.planning` | Blue left border — planning stage |
| `.trip-card.hold` | Gray left border — not confirmed |
| `.trip-card.past` | Light gray, slightly muted — past trip |
| `.action-box` | Orange box for outstanding actions |
| `.flight-row` | One flight leg row with bottom border. Tight `padding: 3px 0` per Dani 2026-05-18 |
| `.flight-detail` | Gray sub-text under a flight row (seats, notes) |
| `.booking-block` | One hotel/venue entry with dotted bottom border |
| `.booking-name` | Bold dark-blue hotel/venue name (19px desktop / 22px mobile) |
| `.booking-dates` | Bold dates line under the booking name |
| `.addr-copy` | Light-gray copy-friendly address box. `user-select: all` for one-tap select on iPhone |
| `.who-tag` | Pill rendered inside `.booking-name`. Combine with `.tag-solo` / `.tag-together` / `.tag-leo` |
| `.tag-solo` | Purple fill — Dani alone at this hotel (matches her purple calendar events) |
| `.tag-leo` | Green fill — Leo-only hotel (matches Leo's green calendar events) |
| `.tag-together` | Green fill — Dani + Leo at this hotel (same green as Leo solo: anything with Leo = green) |
| `.badge-booked` | Green badge |
| `.badge-partial` | Amber badge |
| `.badge-planning` | Blue badge |
| `.badge-hold` | Amber badge, larger — for "not confirmed" |
| `.sec` | Section label within a card (Flights, Hotel, etc.) |
| `.note` | Gray italic small text |
| `.red` | Red bold text for urgent action items |

### Retired classes (do not reintroduce)
- `.who-dani`, `.who-leo`, `.who-together` — removed 2026-05-18. No more per-person sections.
- `.leo-notes`, `.leo-notes-label` — removed 2026-05-18. No raw-notes box.

---

## Adding a new trip

When adding a new trip to the file:

1. Find the correct month section (or add a new month header)
2. Use the single consolidated layout (no Dani/Leo/Together splits)
3. Fill flights chronologically (outbound first, return last, with a `margin-top:10px` gap between groups)
4. Add trains in 🚆 Getting Around
5. Add hotels chronologically — every hotel block follows the required structure (name → dates → plain address → Maps link → room type)
6. Add venue with the hotel→venue distance line
7. Add action box if anything still needs to be booked
8. Start with `.trip-card.planning` or `.trip-card.hold` — update to `.booked` or `.partial` as things get confirmed

---

## When a trip is completed

1. Move the full card to the **PAST TRIPS** section at the bottom
2. Change card class to `.trip-card.past`
3. Change badge to `badge-booked` with text "✅ Done"
4. Remove the action box (nothing left to do)

---

## Hard rules (never break)

### No Leo notes box anywhere
Per Dani 2026-05-18: *"i dont need anything that leo wrote. i will give you any updates as he gives to me."* Do not reintroduce the yellow `.leo-notes` box. If Dani pastes Leo content, it gets folded into the structured fields (dates, addresses, flights) — never preserved as a prose block.

### No Dani / Leo / Together sections
Per Dani 2026-05-18: one consolidated section per trip. Hotels list in chronological order regardless of who's staying where. If a hotel is for Leo only or Dani only, that's clear from the dates and context — no need for a section divider.

### No prose
Per Dani 2026-05-18: *"cut any prose. keep just the things that matter. dates, address of venue."* Walking distance from hotel to venue is **not** prose — it's structured travel data and stays. Special-needs reminders, account ownership notes, rate-plan annotations, and similar are prose — cut them.

### No red "to book" on unconfirmed trips
When a trip status is 🤔 Not confirmed, **don't put red "to book" labels anywhere**. Show the route plainly (SEA → ICN) and put "Don't book anything until Leo confirms" in the action box only. Per Dani: *"lets not put to book on trips not confirmed. i dont want to get confused and book something that he decides not to go."*

### No prices anywhere
No flight cost, no hotel cost, no totals — ever. Cost lives in email/booking confirmation, not in this doc. Per Dani: *"we dont need flights price or any of that."*

### Final bookings always go in Trips.html
Every finalized booking (flight, train, hotel, car rental, tour) saves directly in Trips.html. Not chat-only, not Apple Notes, not email, not a side doc.

### Hotel name is never a hyperlink
Hotel name is plain text only. The only link on a hotel block is the 📍 Maps pin. Per Dani: *"we don't need a link for the hotel website."*

### One 🏨 icon per trip card
The hotel emoji appears only on the section label. Don't use it again on individual hotel names inside the block — it gets too busy.

### Plain-text address is mandatory on every hotel and venue
Per Dani 2026-05-18: every hotel and every venue must have an `.addr-copy` line above the Maps pin link. Skip this and the doc fails its primary on-the-ground use case (one-tap copy into Uber).

### Who-tag is mandatory on every section
Per Dani 2026-05-18 (updated *"i like the lable but no need to repeat before and after"*): every content `.sec` carries the who-tag on its header — `🔵 Dani`, `🟢 Leo`, or `🟣 Dani + Leo`. The booking-names inside don't repeat it. If you're not sure which one applies, ask Dani — don't pick by default.

### Every night must have a hotel for every traveler
Per Dani 2026-05-18 (*"is he sleeping in the streets?"*): both Dani and Leo use this file alongside their calendar. For every night of a trip, the file must show a hotel for everyone who's traveling. If Leo is at an offsite event before reuniting with Dani, his offsite-period hotel goes in the file — even if it's "Leo solo" and not paid for from Dani's account. The point is the trip should narratively make sense for both of them.

### Cross-check against the calendar
Before publishing any update to a trip, list the calendar events for that date range (`list_events`) and verify:
- Every confirmed hotel on the calendar appears in `Trips.html` with the same dates and address. Use the calendar address when they differ — it's the booking source of truth.
- Every traveler has continuous accommodation for every night of the trip.
- Flight times/numbers match.

If something is in `Trips.html` but not on the calendar (e.g. an offsite-arranged hotel that FRO booked for Leo), note it inline — don't quietly drop it.

---

## Flight format details

- Date: `Mon DD` (e.g. May 16, Jul 24)
- Time: `H:MM AM/PM` 12-hour clock (e.g. 5:40 PM)
- Airport codes: IATA 3-letter
- Flight numbers: full `DL####` form
- No "Nonrefundable" annotation — flights are always nonrefundable, label is redundant
- Pending flights on unconfirmed trips: just show the route (`SEA → ICN`), no red callout
- Separate intra-trip legs (not part of main ticket): flag as `· to book (separate leg)` in red

---

## Train operators by country

| Country | Operator | Booking site |
|---|---|---|
| Portugal | CP (Alfa Pendular = fast intercity) | cp.pt |
| Italy | Trenitalia / Italo | trenitalia.com |
| France | SNCF | sncf-connect.com |
| Spain | Renfe | renfe.com |
| UK | National Rail | nationalrail.co.uk |
| Germany | DB | bahn.de |

---

## Icons — reuse existing, don't invent

Use icons already established in the guide vocabulary. Don't introduce new ones unless there's genuinely no equivalent. Established icons: 📋 overview · 🏨 hotel · 🚆 train · 📍 location · 📖 reading · ✈️ flights · 🚗 car rental · 🎟 tour/ticket · 🚶 walk · 🚕 rideshare.

---

# Shared Calendar — Rules

Per Dani 2026-05-19: trip rules and calendar rules live in this one document. The shared **Leo&Dani Trips** Google Calendar is the second surface for trip data; `Trips.html` is the first. Both stay in sync.

## ✅ Calendar event checklist — run EVERY time (per Dani 2026-05-20 "make sure this is done right from now on")

Before considering any calendar event done, confirm all of these. Most of this list exists because each item was missed at least once.

1. **Right calendar** — shared `Leo&Dani Trips` (`5bcee1b776f6103a8448fc95742c5f39c57497de53bbf9abc085cd55ef9c7763@group.calendar.google.com`), not Dani's primary.
2. **Address in the `location` field** — full street address. ⚠️ `create_event` has SILENTLY DROPPED `location` on all-day events. After creating, ALWAYS re-list/re-read the event and confirm `location` is present. If it's missing, set it with `update_event` (which persists reliably).
3. **Phone in the `description`** — `📞 +country-code …`. Mandatory on every hotel. Research it if unknown before marking done.
4. **Color matches who** — 🟢 Sage green (`colorId 2`) for Leo solo AND Dani+Leo together (incl. shared flights); 🟣 Grape purple (`colorId 3`) for Dani solo. Flights they take together are GREEN, not blue.
5. **No extras** — no seat numbers, no room types, no meal plans, no "KLM operated", no rate names/prices. Hotel = name + dates + address + phone. Flight = route + flight#. (Confirmation numbers are allowed in the description.)
6. **No duplicates** — if it's on the shared calendar, it must NOT also be on Dani's primary. Delete the primary copy.
7. **Every night covered for both travelers** — no one "sleeping in the streets".
8. **Matches `Trips.html`** — same name, dates, address, phone, color.

Reads (`list_events`, `list_calendars`) run silently. Writes (`create`/`update`/`delete`) each trigger a Cowork approval prompt — that's the platform, not a Claude limit; don't try to bypass it.

## Calendar identity

- **Name:** `Leo&Dani Trips`
- **ID:** `5bcee1b776f6103a8448fc95742c5f39c57497de53bbf9abc085cd55ef9c7763@group.calendar.google.com`
- **Used by:** Dani + Leo. Both reference this calendar for trip logistics.

Dani's primary `bellinello@gmail.com` calendar holds personal stuff and some duplicates that pre-date the shared calendar — over time, trip events should consolidate to the shared calendar.

## What goes on the shared calendar

Per Dani 2026-05-19 (*"everything that is booked should be in the calendar. we both use the trips shared calendar"* + *"all leos stuff needs to be there. hotel name and address"*):

**Every confirmed/booked trip item lands on the shared calendar.** That includes:
- Hotels — Dani's, Leo's, and Together. Leo's solo hotels (e.g. Arribas during FRO offsite) are still in even when Dani didn't do the booking — they keep both travelers' picture complete.
- Flights — every leg, including outbound and return.
- Trains — every booked segment.
- Car rentals — pickup/dropoff.
- Tours / venues with a fixed date and time (e.g. Sintra Tour, FLoC sessions).

**What stays off the calendar (per Dani 2026-05-19 — *"only add the confirmed stuff"*):**
- Anything with badge 🤔 Not confirmed in `Trips.html` (Seoul, Germany, anything held pending Leo's confirmation).
- Anything with badge 📋 Planning where no date is locked yet (e.g. Iceland June TBD — flights, hotel, car all `to book`).
- Hypothetical or backup itineraries.

Promote events to the calendar the moment a booking is confirmed and dates lock in.

## Event color scheme — matches Trips.html who-tags

Calendar event colors mirror the `who-tag` pill colors in `Trips.html` so the two surfaces tell the same story at a glance:

| Who | Trips.html tag | Calendar color | Google `colorId` |
|---|---|---|---|
| Dani solo | 🟣 `tag-solo` (purple) | Grape | `3` |
| Leo solo | 🟢 `tag-leo` (green) | Sage | `2` |
| Dani + Leo | 🟢 `tag-together` (green) | Sage | `2` |

Mental model: anything involving Leo → green. Dani alone → purple. The Calendar Parity Rule applies in both directions.

## Required event fields

Every calendar event for a hotel, flight, or train must carry:
- **Summary** — emoji + concise label. Hotel pattern: `🏨 [City or neighborhood] — [Hotel Name] · [Who]`. Flight pattern: `✈️ [ORIG] → [DEST] · [Flight#]`.
- **Location** — full plain-text address (rideshare-friendly: commas, no `·` separators).
- **Color** — per the table above.
- **Description** — short context (e.g. "Leo at FRO offsite", "Booked on Dani's Hyatt account — request receipt under Leo's name"). Confirmation numbers and booking refs can live here even though they're banned from `Trips.html`.
- **Start/end dates** — for all-day hotel stays, the end date is the day AFTER checkout (Google Calendar all-day end is exclusive but Dani's pattern is to span the checkout day inclusively, so end-date = checkout-date + 1).

### 🚫 Essentials only — no extras, anywhere

Per Dani 2026-05-20 (*"the code was adding tons of extras"* + *"did i tell you to add canal view etc?"* + *"i want this is the rules too. do not add any of that to the trips HTML or calendar"*): hotel entries — in `Trips.html` AND on the calendar — carry ONLY the essentials. Nothing else.

**Hotels — the only allowed fields:** hotel name · dates · address · phone (· Maps link in Trips.html). That's it.

**Never add (Dani never asked for these — they are clutter):**
- Room type / bed type ("Deluxe Twin", "1 King Classic Ocean View", "Standard Room", "2 Twin Bed With View")
- Meal plan ("Breakfast", "Breakfast daily")
- Room features ("canal view", "Balcony", "City view", "ocean view")
- Rate names, free-cancel dates, prices
- Flight extras: "KLM operated", seat numbers, "Nonrefundable"

**Flights — only:** date · time · route · flight number (· land/arrive time if useful). No operator notes, no seats.
**Trains — only:** date · route · type/duration · booking action if still needed.

If you're tempted to add a descriptive detail "to be helpful" — don't. Dani will ask for it if she wants it. Default to less.

### 🚨 Address + phone are mandatory on every hotel — NEVER miss this

Per Dani 2026-05-20 (*"Why does the calendar not have the hotel address? The most important data?"* + *"address and phone number. ad this to the rules. that cant be missed"*): **every hotel event — on the calendar AND in `Trips.html` — must carry both the full street address and the hotel phone number.** These are the two pieces of data Dani actually needs on the ground (navigation + calling the front desk). They are non-negotiable.

- **Calendar:** address goes in the `location` field (so it's tappable → Maps). Phone goes in the `description`, formatted `📞 +country-code …`. Verify both saved — the create_event call has dropped `location` silently before (2026-05-19 bug); always re-read the event after creating and confirm `location` is present.
- **`Trips.html`:** address in the `.addr-copy` block; phone on its own line right under it, `📞 +…`.
- If a phone number isn't known yet, research it (hotel's official site / Google listing) before marking the hotel done. Don't ship a hotel block or event without it.

When the create tool silently drops `location`, fix it with `update_event` (which persists it correctly) — don't leave the event address-less.

## Trips.html ↔ Calendar parity rules

These two surfaces are kept in sync — any addition or change on one propagates to the other. Per Dani 2026-05-18 (*"is he sleeping in the streets?"*): every traveler should have continuous accommodation on both surfaces for every night of every confirmed trip.

When adding or editing in `Trips.html`:
1. Confirm the booking exists in some source of truth (email, confirmation).
2. Add or update the corresponding calendar event on `Leo&Dani Trips`.
3. Color matches the who-tag.
4. Address matches the `.addr-copy` line exactly.

When adding or editing on the calendar:
1. Update `Trips.html` with the same name, dates, and address.
2. Apply the matching who-tag color in `Trips.html`.

If a calendar event is removed (booking canceled), remove or mark the matching `Trips.html` block as canceled in the same session.

## Calendar event creation needs Dani's approval

Per the Cowork safety model: every calendar write (create, update, delete) triggers a one-time approve/reject prompt for Dani. This is not a Claude limitation — it's the connected-app permission boundary. Don't try to bypass; if Dani rejects, re-read intent and ask before retrying.
